## Log

### 2026-03-05

**Keshav**

- Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub
- Created base folder structure (`core/`, `pipeline/`, `ml/`, `models/`, `monitoring/`, `datasets/`, `notebooks/`)
- Setup Go modules (`go mod init github.com/Keshav76315/turboSH`)
- Setup Python virtual environment (`.venv`, Python 3.10.11)
- Created `requirements.txt`
- Created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (system diagrams, request pipeline, module ownership)
- **EPIC 2 — Core Middleware System:**
  - Implemented reverse proxy (`core/proxy/proxy.go`) — wraps `httputil.ReverseProxy` with Gin
  - Implemented middleware pipeline assembly (`core/proxy/middleware.go`) — ordered chain: Scheduler → RateLimiter → TrafficRules → Cache → Proxy
  - Implemented request scheduler (`core/scheduler/scheduler.go`, `queue.go`) — semaphore-based concurrency control
  - Implemented rate limiter (`core/security/rate_limiter.go`) — per-IP token bucket
  - Implemented traffic rules (`core/security/traffic_rules.go`) — burst detection + endpoint abuse
  - Implemented decision engine (`core/decision/decision_engine.go`) — anomaly score → action mapping
  - Created centralized config system (`config/config.go`) — env vars with sensible defaults
  - Created main entry point (`cmd/turbosh/main.go`)

**Anzal**

- Created `docs/PLAN.md` (Jira-style development plan with 9 EPICs)
- Created documentation templates (`PROGRESS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `README.md`, `DATA_SCHEMA.md`, `API.md`)
- **EPIC 3 — Cache Optimization System:**
  - **Story 3.1 — LRU Cache:**
    - Implemented in-memory LRU cache (`core/cache/lru_cache.go`) — hashmap + doubly linked list
    - Defined `Cache` interface and `CachedResponse` type (`core/cache/cache.go`)
    - Implemented TTL eviction: lazy check in `Get()` + background cleanup goroutine (`core/cache/ttl_manager.go`)
    - Added thread safety via `sync.RWMutex` (concurrent reads, exclusive writes)
    - Added byte-level memory cap (default 512 MB) alongside entry-count limit
    - Wrote 6 unit tests covering LRU eviction, TTL, combined behavior, and concurrency stress (`core/cache/lru_cache_test.go`)
  - **Story 3.2 — Cache Integration:**
    - Implemented Gin-native cache middleware (`core/cache/cache_middleware.go`) — `Middleware() gin.HandlerFunc`
    - Captures backend responses via `ginResponseRecorder` for caching
    - Cache key includes method + path + query params
    - Admission rules: method filtering (GET/HEAD only), status code filtering, `Cache-Control` header respect, body size limit
    - `X-Cache: HIT` header for debugging
    - Integrated into pipeline at slot #4 in `SetupMiddleware()`
    - Implemented stampede protection (`core/cache/stampede.go`) — request coalescing via `singleflight`
  - **Story 3.3 — Cache Metrics:**
    - Implemented lock-free metrics (`core/cache/cache_metrics.go`) — `sync/atomic` counters for hits, misses, evictions
    - `HitRate()` computed on demand, `Snapshot()` returns JSON-serializable struct
    - Metrics auto-instrumented in `LRUCache.Get()` and `evict()`
  - Created demo server (`core/cache/cmd/cache_demo/main.go`) with `/cache/stats` endpoint
  - Added `golang.org/x/sync` dependency for `singleflight`
  - Added `CacheMaxMemory` config field (default 512 MB, env `TURBOSH_CACHE_MAX_MEMORY`)
  - **EPIC 4 — Traffic Logging & Data Pipeline:**
    - Implemented Traffic Logger middleware (`pipeline/logging/traffic_logger.go`)
    - Created Feature Extractor (`pipeline/feature_extraction/feature_extractor.py`)
    - Built Dataset Builder (`pipeline/dataset_builder/build_dataset.py`)
  - **EPIC 5 — Data Analysis & Feature Engineering:**
    - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (`notebooks/traffic_analysis.ipynb`)
    - Simulated Attacks (`datasets/attack_dataset.csv`)

### 2026-03-07

**Keshav**

- **EPIC 6 — Machine Learning System:**
  - Written Synthetic Data Generator (`ml/data/generate_synthetic_data.py`) which generated 22k rows of data.
  - Developed and executed model training script via GridSearchCV (`ml/training/train_model.py`) over IsolationForest, One-Class SVM and LOF.
  - Selected IsolationForest as winner (Validation F1 Score ~0.99).
  - Authored evaluation report documenting the selection (`docs/model_evaluation_report.md`).
  - Exported the finalized model via skl2onnx (`ml/export/export_onnx.py` to `models/anomaly_model.onnx`).
